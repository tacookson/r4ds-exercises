### Question 1

What function would you use to read a file where fields are separated with a "|"?


### Question 2

Apart from `file`, `skip`, and `comment`, what other arguments do `read_csv()` and `read_tsv()` have in common?


### Question 3

What are the most important argument to `read_fwf()`?


### Question 4

Sometimes strings in a CSV files contain commas. To prevent them from causing problems they need to be surrounded by a quoting character, like " or '. By convention, `read_csv()` assumes that the quoting character will be ", and if you want to change it you'll need to use `read_delim()` instead. What arguments do you need to specify to read the following text into a data frame?

> "x,y\n1,'a,b'"


### Question 5

Identify what is wrong with each of the following inline CSV files. What happens when you run the code?

```{r q5, eval = FALSE}
read_csv("a,b\n1,2,3\n4,5,6")
read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2\n1,2,3,4")
read_csv("a,b\n\"1")
read_csv("a,b\n1,2\na,b")
read_csv("a;b\n1;3")
```
