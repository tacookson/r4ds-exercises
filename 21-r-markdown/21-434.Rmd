### Question 1

Add a section that explores how diamond sizes vary by cut, colour, and clarity. Assume you're writing a report for someone who doesn't know R, and instead of setting `echo = FALSE` on each chunk, set a global option.


### Question 2

Download *diamond-sizes.Rmd* from *https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/master/rmarkdown*. Add a section that describes the largest 20 diamonds, including a table that displays their most important attributes.
