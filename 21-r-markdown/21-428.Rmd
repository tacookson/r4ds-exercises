### Question 1

Practice what you've learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold.


### Question 2

Using the R Markdown quick reference, figure out how to:

a. Add a footnote.
b. Add a horizontal rule.
c. Add a block quote.


### Question 3

Copy and paste the contents of *diamond-sizes.Rmd* from *https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/master/rmarkdown* into a local R Markdown document. Check that you can run it, then add text after the frequency polygon that describes its most striking features.
