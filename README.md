## R for Data Science Exercises

This repository has exercise solutions to [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It follow these rules of organization:

- Chapters have their own folders, named by chapter number and name (e.g., `01-data-visualization-with-ggplot2`)
- Each exercise "block" has its own R Markdown file, named by the chapter number and the page the "Exercises" header appears on (e.g., the 7 exercise questions in Chapter 8 on pages 136-137 are named `08-136.Rmd`)
