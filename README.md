## R for Data Science Exercises

This repository has exercise solutions to [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It follow these rules of organization:

- Chapters have their own folders, named by chapter number and name (e.g., `01-data-visualization-with-ggplot2`)
- Each exercise question has its own R Markdown (.Rmd) file, named by the page the "Exercises" header appears on and the exercise number (e.g., exercise 2 of an "exercise block" from page 90 would be `90-2.Rmd`, even if question two is *actually* on page 91).
