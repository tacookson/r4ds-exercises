### Question 1

What happens if you repeat the analysis of `sim2` using a model without an intercept? What happens to the model equation? What happens to the predictions?


### Question 2

Use `model_matrix()` to explore the equations generated for the models I fit to `sim3` and `sim4`. Why is `*` a good shorthand for interaction?


### Question 3

Using the basic principles, convert the formulas in the following two models into functions. (Hint: start by converting the categorical variable into 0-1 variables.)

```{r q3, eval = FALSE}
mod1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = sim3)
mod2 <- lm(y ~ x1 * x2, data = sim3)
```


### Question 4

For `sim4`, which of `mod1` and `mod2` is better? I think `mod2` does a slightly better job at removing patterns, but it's pretty subtle. Can you come up with a plot to support my claim?
