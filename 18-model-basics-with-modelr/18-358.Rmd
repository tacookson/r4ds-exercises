### Question 1

Instead of using `lm()` to fit a straight line, you can use `loess()` to fit a smooth curve. Repeat the process of model fitting, grid generation, predictions, and visualization on `sim1` using `loess()` instead of `lm()`. How does the result compare to `geom_smooth()`?


### Question 2

`add_predictions()` is paired with `gather_predictions()` and `spread_predictions()`. How do these functions differ?


### Question 3

What does `geom_ref_line()` do? What package does it come from? Why is displaying a reference line in plots showing residuals useful and important?


### Question 4

Why might you want to look at a frequency polygon of absolute residuals? What are the pros and cons compared to looking at the raw residuals?
