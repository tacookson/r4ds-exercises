### Question 1

What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

```{r q1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = "blue")
  )
```


### Question 2

Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?


### Question 3

Map a continuous variable to `colour`, `size`, and `shape`. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical versus continuous variables?


### Question 4

What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?


### Question 5

What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use `?geom_point`.)


### Question 6

What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?
