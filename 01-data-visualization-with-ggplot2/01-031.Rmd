### Question 1

What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

```{r q1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Question 2

What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?


### Question 3

Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.


### Question 4

What's the default position adjustment for `geom_boxplot()`? Create a visualization of the `mpg` dataset that demonstrates it.
