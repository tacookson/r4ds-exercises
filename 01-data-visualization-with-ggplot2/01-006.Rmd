### Question 1

Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?


### Question 2

How many rows are in `mtcars`? How many columns?


### Question 3

What does the `drv` variable describe? Read the help for `?mpg` to find out.


### Question 4

Make a scatterplot of `hwy` versus `cyl`.


### Question 5

What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` versus `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?
