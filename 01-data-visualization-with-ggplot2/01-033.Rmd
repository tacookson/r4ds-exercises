### Question 1

Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using `coord_polar()`.


### Question 2

What does `labs()` do? Read the documentation.


### Question 3

What's the difference between `coord_quickmap()` and `coord_map()`?


### Question 4

What does the following plot tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does `geom_abline()` do?

```{r q4, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```
