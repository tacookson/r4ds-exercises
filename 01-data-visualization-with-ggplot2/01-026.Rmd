### Question 1

What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?


### Question 2

What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?


### Question 3

Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs? What do they have in common?


### Question 4

What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control its behaviour?


### Question 5

In our proportion bar chart, we need to set `group = 1`. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?

```{r q5, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..)
  )
```
