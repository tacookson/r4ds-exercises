### Question 1

Use `geom_text()` with infinite positions to place text at the four corners of the plot.


### Question 2

Read the documentation for `annotate()`. How can you use it to add a text label to a plot without having to create a tibble?


### Question 3

How do labels with `geom_text()` interact with faceting? How can you add a label to a single facet? How can you put a different label in each facet? (Hint: think about the underlying data.)


### Question 4

What arguments to `geom_label()` control the appearance of the background box?


### Question 5

What are the four arguments to `arrow()`? How do they work? Create a series of plot that demonstrate the most important options.
