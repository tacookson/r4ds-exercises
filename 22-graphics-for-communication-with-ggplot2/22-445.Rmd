### Question 1

Create one plot on the fuel economy data with customized `title`, `subtitle`, `caption`, `x`, `y`, and `colour` labels.


### Question 2

The `geom_smooth()` function is somewhat misleading because the `hwy` for large engines is skewed upwards due to the inclusion of lightweight sports cars with big engines. Use your modelling tools to fit and display a better model.


### Question 3

Take an exploratory graphic that you've created in the last month, and add informative titles to make it easier for others to understand.
