### Question 1

Why doesn't the following code override the default scale?

```{r q1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +
  coord_fixed()
```

### Question 2

What is the first argument to every scale? How does it compare to `labs()`?


### Question 3

Change the display of the presidential terms by:

a. Combining the two variants shown above.
b. Improving the display of the y-axis.
c. Labelling each term with the name of the president.
d. Adding informative plot labels.
e. Placing breaks every four years (this is trickier than it seems!)


### Question 4

Use `override.aes` to make the legend on the following plot easier to see:

```{r q4, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = cut), alpha = 1/20)
```
