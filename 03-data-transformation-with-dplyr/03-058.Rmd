### Question 1

Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they're not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.


### Question 2

Compare `air_time` wotj `arr_time - dep_time`. What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?


### Question 3

Compare `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time`, and `dep_delay`. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?


### Question 4

Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for `min_rank()`.


### Question 5

What does `1:3 + 1:10` return? Why?


### Question 6

What trigonometric functions does R provide?
