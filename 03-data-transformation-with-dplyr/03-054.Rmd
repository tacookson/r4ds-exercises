### Question 1

Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from `flights`.


### Question 2

What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a `select()` call?


### Question 3

What does the `one_of()` function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

```{r q3, eval = FALSE}
vars <- c(
  "year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay"
)
```


### Question 4

Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?

```{r q4, eval = FALSE}
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```
