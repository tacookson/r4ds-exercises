### Question 1

In code that doesn't use **stringr**, you'll often see `paste()` and `paste0()`. What's the difference between the two functions? What **stringr** function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of `NA`?


### Question 2

In your own words, describe the difference beween the `sep` and `collapse` arguments to `str_c()`.


### Question 3

Use `str_length()` and `str_sub()` to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?


### Question 4

What does `str_wrap()` do? When might you want to use it?


### Question 5

What does `str_trim()` do? What's the opposite of `str_trim()`?


### Question 6

Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector `c("a", "b", "c")` into the string `a`, `b`, and `c`. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2.
