### Question 1

Create regular expressions to find all words that:

a. Start with a vowel
b. Only contain consonants. (Hint: think about matching "not"-vowels.)
c. End with `ed`, but not with `eed`.
d. End with `ing` or `ize`.


### Question 2

Empirically verify the rule "i before e except after c."


### Question 3

Is "q" always followed by a "u"?


### Question 4

Write a regular expression that matches a word if it's probably written in British English, not American English.


### Question 5

Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country.
