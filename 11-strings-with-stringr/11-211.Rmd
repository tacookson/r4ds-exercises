### Question 1

For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression and a combination of multiple `str_detect()` calls:

a. Find all words that start or end with `x`.
b. Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
c. Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?
d. What word has the highest proportion of vowels? (Hint: what is the denominator?)
