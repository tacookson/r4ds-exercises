### Question 1

How would you match the literal string `"$^$"`?


### Question 2

Given the corpus of common words in `stringr::words`, create regular expressions that find all words that:

a. Start with "y".
b. End with "x".
c. Are exactly three letters long. (Don't cheat by using `str_length()`!)
d. Have seven letters or more.

Since this list is long, you might want to use the `match` argument to `str_view()` to show only the matching or non-matching words.
