### Question 1

Implement your own version of `every()` using a for loop. Compare it with `purrr:every()`. What does **purrr**'s version do that your version doesn't?


### Question 2

Create an enhanced `col_sum()` that applies a summary function to every numeric column in a data frame.


### Question 3

A possible base R equivalent of `col_sum()` is:

```{r q3-1, eval = FALSE}
col_sum3 <- function(df, f) {
  is_num <- sapply(df, is.numeric)
  df_num <- df[, is_num]
  
  sapply(df_num, f)
}
```

But it has a number of bugs as illustrated with the following inputs:

```{r q3-2, eval = FALSE}
df <- tibble(
  x = 1:3,
  y = 3:1,
  z = c("a", "b", "c")
)
# OK
col_sum3(df, mean)
# Has problems: doesn't always return numeric vector
col_sum3(df[1:2], mean)
col_sum3(df[1], mean)
col_sum3(df[0], mean)
```

What causes the bugs?
