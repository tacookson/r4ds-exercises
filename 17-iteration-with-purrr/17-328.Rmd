### Question 1

Write code that uses one of the map functions to:

a. Compute the mean of every column in `mtcars`.
b. Determine the type of each column in `nycflights13::flights`.
c. Compute the number of unique values in each column of `iris`.
d. Generate 10 random normals for each of $\mu$ = -10, 0, 10, and 100.


### Question 2

How can you create a single vector that for each column in a data frame indicates whether or not it's a factor?


### Question 3

What happens when you use the map functions on vectors that aren't lists? What does `map(1:5, runif)` do? Why?


### Question 4

What does `map(-2:2, rnorm, n = 5)` do? Why? What does `map_dbl(-2:2, rnorm, n = 5)` do? Why?


### Question 5

Rewrite `map(x, function(df) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = df))` to eliminate the anonymous function.
