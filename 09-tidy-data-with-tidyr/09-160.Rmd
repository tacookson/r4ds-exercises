### Question 1

What do the `extra` and `fill` arguments do in `separate()`? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets:

```{r q1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>%
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>%
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```


### Question 2

Both `unite()` and `separate()` have a `remove` argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to `FALSE`?


### Question 3

Compare and contrast `separate()` and `extract()`. Why are there three variations of separation (by position, by separator, and with groups), but only one unite?
