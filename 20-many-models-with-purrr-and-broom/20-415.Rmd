### Question 1

List all the functions that you can think of that take an atomic vector and return a list.


### Question 2

Brainstorm useful summary functions that, like `quantile()`, return multiple values.


### Question 3

What's missing in the following data frame? How does `quantile()` return the missing piece? Why isn't that helpful here?

```{r q3, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(q = list(quantile(mpg))) %>%
  unnest()
```


### Question 4

What does this code do? Why might it be useful?

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(list))
```
