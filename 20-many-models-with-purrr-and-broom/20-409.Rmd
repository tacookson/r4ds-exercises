### Question 1

A linear trend seems to be slightly too simple for the overall trend. Can you do better with a quadratic polynomial? How can you interpret the coefficients of the quadratic? (Hint: you might want to transform `year` so that is has mean zero.)


### Question 2

Explore other methods for visualizing the distribution of *R^2^* per continent. You might want to try the **ggbeeswarm** package, which provides similar methods for acoiding overlaps as jitter, but uses deterministic methods.


### Question 3

To create the last plot (showing the data for the countries with the worst model fits), we needed two steps: we created a data frame with one row per country and then semi-joined it to the original dataset. It's possible to avoid this join if we use `unnest()` instead of `unnest(.drop = TRUE)`. How?
