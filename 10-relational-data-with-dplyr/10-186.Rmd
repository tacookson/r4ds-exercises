### Question 1

Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the `airports` data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here's an easy way to draw a map of the United States:

```{r q1, eval = FALSE}
airports %>%
  semi_john(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap()
```

(Don't worry if you don't understand what `semi_join()` does -- you'll learn about it next.)

You might want to use the `size` or `colour` of the points to display the average delay for each airport.


### Question 2

Add the location of the origin *and* destination (i.e., the `lat` and `lon`) to `flights`.


### Question 3

Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?


### Question 4

What weather conditions make it more likely to see a delay?


### Question 5

What happened on June 13, 2013? Display the spatial pattern of delays, and then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.
