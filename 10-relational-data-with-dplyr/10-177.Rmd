### Question 1

Add a surrogate key to `flights`.


### Question 2

Identify the keys in the following datasets:

a. `Lahman::Batting`
b. `babynames::babynames`
c. `nasaweather::atmos`
d. `fueleconomy::vehicles`
e. `ggplot2::diamonds`

(You might need to install some packages and read some documentation.)


### Question 3

Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the `Batting`, `Master`, and `Salaries` tables in the **Lahman** package. Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between `Master`, `Managers`, and `AwardsManagers`.

How would you characterize the relationship between the `Batting`, `Pitching`, and `Fielding` tables?
