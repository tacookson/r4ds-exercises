### Question 1

How would you rescale the `count` dataset to more clearly show the distribution of cut within color, or color within cut?


### Question 2

Use `geom_tile()` together with **dplyr** to explore how average flight delays vary by destination and month of year. What makes the plot difficult to read? How could you improve it?


### Question 3

Why is it slightly better to use `aes(x = color, y cut)` rather than `aes(x = cut, y = color)` in the previous example?
