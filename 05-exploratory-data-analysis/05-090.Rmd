### Question 1

Explore the distribution of each of the `x`, `y`, and `z` variables in `diamonds`. What do you learn? Think about a diamond and how you might decide which dimension is the length, width, and depth.


### Question 2

Explore the distribution of `price`. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising? (Hint: carefully think about the `binwidth` and make sure you try a range of values.)


### Question 3

How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What do you think is the cause of the difference?


### Question 4

Compare and contrast `coord_cartesian()` versus `xlim()` or `ylim()` when zooming in on a histogram. What happens if you leave `binwidth` unset? What happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?
