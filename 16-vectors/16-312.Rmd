### Question 1

What does `hms:hms(3600)` return? How does it print? What primitive type is the augmented vector built on top of? What attributes does it use?


### Question 2

Try and make a tibble that has columns with different lengths. What happens?

Based off the previous definition, is it OK to have a list as a column of a tibble?
