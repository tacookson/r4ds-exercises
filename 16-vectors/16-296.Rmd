### Question 2

Read the source code for `dplyr::near()` (Hint: to see the source code, drop the `()`). How does it work?


### Question 3

A logical vector can take three possible values. How many possible values can an integer vector take? How many possible values can a double take? Use Google to do some research.


### Question 4

Brainstorm at least four functions that allow you to convert a double to an integer. How do they differ? Be precise.


### Question 5

What functions from the **readr** package allow you to turn a string into a logical, integer, and double vector?
