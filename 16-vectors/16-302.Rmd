### Question 1

What does `mean(is.na(x))` tell you about a vector `x`? What about `sum(!is.finite(x))`?


### Question 2

Carefully read the documentation of `is.vector()`. What does it actually test for? Why does `is.atomic()` not agree with the definition of atomic vectors above?


### Question 3

Compare and contrast `setNames()` with `purrr::set_names()`.


### Question 4

Create functions that take a vector as input and return:

a. The last value. Should you use `[` or `[[`?
b. The elemnts at even numbered positions.
c. Every element except the last value.
d. Only even numbers (and no missing values).


### Question 5

Why is `x[-which(x > 0)]` not the same as `x[x <= 0]`?


### Question 6

What happens when you subset with a positive integer that's bigger than the length of the vector? What happens when you subset with a name that doesn't exist?
