### Question 1

Read the source code for each of the following three functions, puzzle out what they do, and then brainstorm better names:

```{r q1, eval = FALSE}
f1 <- function(string, prefix) {
  substr(string, 1, nchar(prefix)) == prefix
}
f2 <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) <= 1) return(NULL)
  x[-length(x)]
}
f3 <- function(x, y) {
  rep(y, length.out = length(x))
}
```


### Question 2

Take a function that you've written recently and spend five minutes brainstorming a better name for it and its arguments.


### Question 3

Compare and contrast `rnorm()` and `MASS::mvrnorm()`. How could you make them more consistent?


### Question 4

Make a case for why `norm_r()`, `norm_d()`, etc., would be better than `rnorm()`, `dnorm()`. Make a case for the opposite.
