### Question 1

What does `commas(letters, collapse = "-")` do? Why?


### Question 2

It'd be nice if you could supply multiple characters to the `pad` argument, e.g., `rule("Title", pad = "-+")`. Why doesn't this currently work? How could you fix it?


### Question 3

What does the `trim` argument to `mean()` do? When might you use it?


### Question 4

The default value for the `method` argument to `cor()` is `c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman")`. What does that mean? What value is used by default?
