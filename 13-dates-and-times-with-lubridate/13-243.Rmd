### Question 1

What happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates?

```{r q1, eval = FALSE}
ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
```


### Question 2

What does the `tzone` argument to `today()` do? Why is it important?


### Question 3

Use the appropriate **lubridate** function to parse each of the following dates:

```{r}
d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
```
