### Question 1

Why does this code not work?

```{r q1, eval = FALSE}
my_variable <- 10
my_varÄ±able
```

Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference twill pay off when programming.)


### Question 2

Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

```{r q2, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```


### Question 3

Press Alt-Shift-K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?
